[Intensity Bursts in WallStreetBets Discussion
and Stock Markets Trading ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5030887)
(With [Yoichi Otsubo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ravVQhcAAAAJ) 
and [Ser-Huang Poon](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=cSrJhbIAAAAJ), available on SSRN)
* Abstract: Our study introduces the concept of WallStreetBets (WSB) submission 
  intensity bursts (IB), offering a novel perspective by distinguishing varying 
  levels of social media activity. Using a Difference-in-Differences approach, 
  we establish a causal link between IBs and key market outcomes, including trading 
  turnover, daily and overnight abnormal returns. We further find that IBs during 
  regular trading hours (RTH) have a stronger and more lasting impact on stock 
  returns compared to those outside RTH, with swift reversals observed on a 
  half-day basis. Additionally, stocks targeted by WSB users typically exhibit 
  a decrease in short interest ratios following an IB, suggesting the WSB users 
  may anticipate short squeeze opportunities, adding strategic nuance to social 
  media’s market influence.

* Abstract: Our analysis of over 150,000 WallStreetBets comments reveals dominant 
  phrases when members of the community experience collective excitement and 
  solidarity (Collective Effervescence). Using the novel Vocabulary Herfindahl 
  Index (VocaHIn), we find that stock returns volatility increases after CE, 
  and vice versa.

Work in Progress
======
LLM and Transparency in Supply Chains 
(with [Ser-Huang Poon](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=cSrJhbIAAAAJ))
* In this paper, we apply a state-of-art Large Language Model 
  to evaluate Social reports related to business supply chains. 
  We also explore a number of factors that are crucial for 
  evaluating corporate disclosure quality.
* Presentations: 2022 British Academy of Management (BAM)

User Patterns in Financial Social Media 
(with [Yoichi Otsubo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ravVQhcAAAAJ) and [Ser-Huang Poon](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=cSrJhbIAAAAJ))
* In this paper, we implement Prompt Engineering, the process 
  of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and 
  understood by a generative AI model, in specific financial 
  social media text data. We also find an intriguing 
  behavioural pattern that shows how the users on financial 
  social media interact with each other.
