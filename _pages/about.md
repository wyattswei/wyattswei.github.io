Hello and Welcome! 

My name is Siliang Wei. You can also call me Wyatt. 
I am currently a Bayes Fellow in Banking and Finance at 
Bayes Business School (formerly Cass), City St George's, University of London. 
Before joining Bayes, I completed my PhD at Alliance Manchester Business School, 
The University of Manchester. My current research interest lies in 
applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques 
to the fields of Empirical Asset Pricing and ESG (CSR) research.

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, hiking, 
watching/playing football, and making/drinking coffee.

Please feel free to check my research, teaching experience, and 
CV on this website.

Thank you for visiting!
