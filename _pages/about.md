Hello and Welcome! My name is Siliang Wei. You can also call me Wyatt. 
I am currently a PhD candidate in Finance at Alliance Manchester 
Business School, the University of Manchester. My academic journey is 
driven by a passion for applying cutting-edge Machine Learning and 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the fields of 
Empirical Asset Pricing and ESG (CSR) research.

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, hiking, 
watching/playing football, and making/drinking coffee.

Please feel free to check my research, teaching experience, and 
CV on this website.

Thank you for visiting!
