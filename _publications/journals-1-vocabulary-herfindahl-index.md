* Abstract: Our analysis of over 150,000 WallStreetBets comments reveals dominant 
  phrases when members of the community experience collective excitement and 
  solidarity (Collective Effervescence). Using the novel Vocabulary Herfindahl 
  Index (VocaHIn), we find that stock returns volatility increases after CE, 
  and vice versa.
