* Abstract: Our study introduces the concept of WallStreetBets (WSB) submission 
  intensity bursts (IB), offering a novel perspective by distinguishing varying 
  levels of social media activity. Using a Difference-in-Differences approach, 
  we establish a causal link between IBs and key market outcomes, including trading 
  turnover, daily and overnight abnormal returns. We further find that IBs during 
  regular trading hours (RTH) have a stronger and more lasting impact on stock 
  returns compared to those outside RTH, with swift reversals observed on a 
  half-day basis. Additionally, stocks targeted by WSB users typically exhibit 
  a decrease in short interest ratios following an IB, suggesting the WSB users 
  may anticipate short squeeze opportunities, adding strategic nuance to social 
  media’s market influence.
