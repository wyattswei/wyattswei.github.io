* In this paper, we implement Prompt Engineering, the process 
  of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and 
  understood by a generative AI model, in specific financial 
  social media text data. We also find an intriguing 
  behavioural pattern that shows how the users on financial 
  social media interact with each other.
